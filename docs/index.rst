HP Comware Ansible Modules
##########################

Introduction
============

This project contains Ansible modules that can be used to automate HP Comware 7 switches.  The modules rely on NETCONF to communicate with the device for making configuration changes and getting operational data back such as LLDP neighbors, OS, serial number, uptime, and active interfaces on the device.
